# ATMS-523-Module-5  Alexa Taylor

Module Homework #6 for ATMS 523. In this homwork I aggregated the tornado data over Illinois for a monthly count of tornadoes. 
I then merged this monthly tornado dataset with the ENSO, MJO, NAO, and AO. Then explored creating a random forest regression model and one-hot encoding. 
Then performed a feature importance and multipass permutation analysis of the features along with a SHAP summary plot and a SHAP feature dependance for the ENSO index.
